			<q>What Makes A Great Software Engineer?</q>
			<br>
			Our results, however, are the first time a comprehensive set of
			attributes for software engineering has been identified and described. In
			addition, there are several important implications. First, our
			results suggest that productivity is only one criterion for
			excellence. How the engineering is conducted, relative to
			management (e.g. managing expectations), subordinates (e.g.
			creating a safe haven), teammates (e.g. asking for help), partners
			(e.g. creating shared success), and even oneself (e.g.
			perseverant), are all critical. This reinforces the perspective that
			software engineering is a sociotechnical undertaking, and not
			just a technical one. Furthermore, simply delivering the code is
			also insufficient. With attributes like elegant, creative, longtermed,
			and seeing the forest and the trees, our results indicate
			that good software engineering requires engineers to make
			complex, experienced-driven, contextual considerations.
